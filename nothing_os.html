	<div><h1 class="bigh2">Nothing OS</h1><p>Nothing OS, developed by Nothing, a tech company founded by Carl Pei, debuted with the Nothing Phone (1) in 2022 as a minimalist Android-based system. Its "dot matrix" design, inspired by retro tech, emphasizes simplicity, smooth performance, and a bloatware-free experience, integrating features like the Glyph Interface for LED notifications. While praised for its unique aesthetic, early versions lacked some advanced features compared to rivals like Samsung’s One UI.<br><br>

Nothing OS has evolved through user-focused updates, with Nothing OS 2.0 (2023) introducing enhanced widgets, glyph features, and efficiency improvements. By 2025, Nothing OS 3.0, built on Android 14, offers AI personalization, better multitasking, and ecosystem integration with Nothing’s wearables, establishing it as a polished, distinctive Android skin.</p></div>
